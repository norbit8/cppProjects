In this exercise we created our first cpp classes
representing a field of numbers and a number in a field.
also, we overloaded some operators like +, -, % and also
<<, >>.
I started writing the exercise with efficiency on my mind,
because I learned that cpp is a very efficient programming language and that
we can make our program run faster than programmes in python (for example).

I implemented the gcd algorithm as a recursive one at the beginning,
but than I thought that it could cause a stack-overflow so I changed it
to an iterative one.

also I declared the operators >> and << as friends of my classes, because we need the istream class
to have the function >> (or << in ostream class) which get GFNumber/GField as an instance.

In this exercise we implemented the Direct Search Factorization algorithm
which is a brute force based algorithm to factorize a given number.
also we implemented the Pollard's Rho algorithm for factorizing which
uses a more straightforward approach.

In the GFNumber class, when one uses any ctor with a given number and a field, the number
gets converted (if needed) to the equivalent number in the given field.
In order to get this behavior I implemented a private method which gets any long number and
converts it to the number's representation in the given field.

furthermore I implemented a checkValidityField function which is also a private method
inside the GFNumber class, which takes any GField and verifies that it is the same field as
the current instance of GFNumber.

One important method is the getPrimeFactors which will return an array of all the prime
factors of a given number, note that I allocate memory dynamically inside the function
and the destruction of the allocated array is the responsibility of the user.
