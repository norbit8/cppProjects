In this exercise we created our first cpp classes
representing a field of numbers and a number in a field.
also, we overloaded some operators like +, -, % and also
<<, >>.
I started writing the exercise with efficiency on my mind,
because I learned that cpp is a very efficient programming language and that
we can make our program run faster than programmes in python (for example).

I implemented the gcd algorithm as a recursive one at the beginning,
but than I thought that it could cause a stack-overflow so I changed it
to an iterative one.

also I declared the operators >> and << as friends of my classes, because we need the istream class
to have the function >> (or << in ostream class) which get GFNumber/GField as an instance.

In this exercise we implemented the Direct Search Factorization algorithm
which is a brute force based algorithm to factorize a given number.
also we implemented the Pollard's Rho algorithm for factorizing which
uses a more straightforward approach.
