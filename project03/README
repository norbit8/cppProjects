In this exercise I created a generic hash map data structure which has an iterator (which
makes it iterable), the hash map is a vector of vectors of pairs where each vector is the bucket
in the open hash implementation, and each pair hold a key and a value.

After I finished implementing the hash map I constructed the main file which is the
SpamDetector.cpp, there I loaded a user input files and an integer number and scanned one file
for spam words given the restricted words of the other file.


This project contains the following files:
1. README (this)
2. SpamDetector.cpp
3. HashMap.hpp
