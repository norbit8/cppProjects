In this exercise I created a generic hash map data structure which has an iterator (which
makes it iterable), the hash maps bucket is vectors of pairs.
We used the open hashing resolution, and each pair hold a key and a value.

After I finished implementing the hash map I constructed the main file which is the
SpamDetector.cpp, there I loaded a user input files and an integer number and scanned one file
for spam words given the restricted words of the other file.

This project contains the following files:
1. README (this)
2. SpamDetector.cpp
3. HashMap.hpp

 perhaps, the end of the beginning." -Winston Churchill
Thanks for a fun course!
