Winning amount!
Hello there, I'm Mark Zuckerberg, the founder and CEO of the social-networking website Facebook, as well as one of the world's youngest billionaires. I decided to secretly give $1,500,000.00 selected individuals worldwide at random. You should count yourself as the lucky individual. Your email address was chosen online while searching at random. Kindly email me back with your bank account details and Facebook username and password so that I can verify your identity and send you the money.
Kind regards,
Mark Zuckerberg.
