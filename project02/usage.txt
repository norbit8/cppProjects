C++ exercise 2 Tester v_1.1
Author: Mattan Yeroushalmi

Simply xtract the archive to the folder including your project files and run from terminal.
This tester is meant to be run on the aquarium computers.

To compare your output with school output use the command 

"vimdiff school_<test_num> student_<test_num>"

from the solutions folder. "test_num" appears when running the tester
and it will say fail if there is a mismatch.

Thank you Nadav Har-Tuv for supplying 28 of the test files.

Don't delete the solutions folder or you will get an error when running the tester.


V1.1
For people using boost - the command is "tester b" and will not compile your files for you. You should complie them into a file called DrawFractal
